    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        Glad to have you here! This page is still new so I am working on it, but here are a few links to my stuff:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kohler.zuehlke/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kohlerz" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.github.com/kohlerz" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        I like to call myself a 'professional tinkerer', finishing up my degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin Madison.
        I don't want to put my email here quite yet, but shoot me a message on Instagram or LinkedIn if you like what you see!
        (ps this page loaded really fast didn't it? I make it with my own brain if you can't tell). I also take pictures sometimes, and really like robots.
